  # MoltenDB

  ### 🌋 A Local-First Embedded Database in Pure Rust

  **Runs in the browser (WASM + OPFS) and on the server (Rust + disk).**  
  Same query engine. Same log format. Two environments.

  **Request only the fields you need — like GraphQL, but over a plain JSON API.**

## What is MoltenDB?

MoltenDB is a JSON document database written in Rust that compiles to both a native server binary and a WebAssembly module. The same query engine runs in your browser (via WASM + OPFS) and on your server (via a Rust binary + disk). Data written in the browser persists across page reloads and can optionally sync to the server.

One of MoltenDB's core features is **GraphQL-style field selection**: every query lets you specify exactly which fields (including deeply nested ones) you want back. You never receive more data than you asked for — no over-fetching, no under-fetching, no separate schema to maintain.

---

## What Actually Works Today

### ✅ Browser (WASM + OPFS)
- Full document store running inside a Web Worker — zero main-thread blocking
- Data persists across page reloads using the Origin Private File System (OPFS)
- Automatic log compaction: count-based (every 500 inserts) and size-based (> 5 MB)
- Analytics queries: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` with `WHERE` filtering
- **`moltendb-wasm` npm package** — bundles the WASM engine, Web Worker, and main-thread client into a single publishable artifact
- **`moltendb-query-builder` npm package** — type-safe, chainable query builder (CJS + ESM + `.d.ts`)

### ✅ Server (Rust binary)
- HTTPS-only server with TLS (cert + key required)
- JWT authentication (`POST /login` → bearer token)
- Per-IP sliding-window rate limiting
- At-rest encryption with XChaCha20-Poly1305 (on by default, key from `--encryption-key`)
- Two write modes: async (50 ms flush, high throughput) and sync (flush-on-write, zero data loss)
- Two storage modes: standard (single log file) and tiered (hot + cold log, mmap cold reads)
- Binary snapshots on compaction for fast startup (snapshot + delta replay, not full log replay)
- Size-based compaction trigger (> 100 MB) in addition to the hourly timer
- WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) for real-time push notifications — subscribe and receive change events on every write

### ✅ Query Engine (shared between browser and server)
- **GraphQL-style field selection** — request only the fields you need using `fields` (include) or `excludedFields` (exclude). Dot-notation works at any depth: `"specs.display.features.refresh_rate"` returns only that one nested value, not the whole document.
- `WHERE` clause with: `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$contains` / `$ct` (strings and arrays), `$in` / `$oneOf`, `$nin` / `$notIn`
- Field projection (`fields`) and field exclusion (`excludedFields`) — mutually exclusive, validated before any data is read
- Pagination: `count` (limit) and `offset`
- Cross-collection joins with dot-notation foreign keys
- Auto-indexing: fields queried 3+ times get an index automatically; equality lookups become O(1)
- Range query index acceleration: `$gt`/`$lt` scan the index values instead of all documents
- Document versioning: every document automatically gets `_v`, `createdAt`, `modifiedAt`
- Conflict resolution: incoming writes with `_v ≤ stored _v` are silently skipped (server wins)
- Inline reference embedding (`extends`): embed data from another collection at insert time

### ✅ Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt / argon2
- JWT tokens signed with HMAC-SHA256, 24-hour expiry
- Credentials loaded from environment variables at startup (no hardcoded defaults in production)
- Input validation: collection names, key names, field names, JSON depth (max 32), payload size (max 10 MB), batch size (max 1000 keys)
- Security headers on every response: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `HSTS`, `CSP`, etc.
- Graceful shutdown: drains in-flight requests (up to 30 s), then flushes the DB before exit

### ✅ Developer Tooling
- **Query Explorer** (`src/moltenDB_wasm_tests/raw-json-explorer.html`) — run raw JSON queries against the WASM engine in the browser, with live events panel and activity log
- **Query Builder Explorer** (`src/moltenDB_wasm_tests/query-builder-explorer.html`) — same explorer but using the chainable query builder API
- **Server Query Builder** (`src/server_test/server-query-builder.html`) — identical layout, targets the HTTP server instead of WASM
- **WebSocket Tester** (`src/ws_test/websocket-test.html`) — connect, authenticate, and observe real-time push events
- **57+ documented example requests** in `src/requests.http`
- **56 integration tests** covering all query features, versioning, persistence, compaction, concurrency, and analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85+ (`rustup update stable`)
- `wasm-pack` for the browser build (`cargo install wasm-pack`)
- Node.js 18+ (for the dev server and npm packages)
- A TLS certificate and key (for the server)

### Generate a self-signed certificate (development only)

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

### Build the WASM package

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

### Run the server

```bash
# Set credentials (REQUIRED)
export MOLTENDB_ADMIN_USER=myuser
export MOLTENDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=str0ng-p4ssw0rd

# Run the app
cargo run --release

# Or with CLI flags (equivalent)
cargo run --release -- \
  --admin-user myuser \
  --admin-password str0ng-p4ssw0rd \
  --jwt-secret another-strong-secret \
  --encryption-key my-encryption-password \
  --port 1538

# Verbose debug logging (optimizer, indexing, compaction details)
cargo run --release -- --debug
```

Run `cargo run -- --help` to see all available flags.

### Run the WASM demo

```bash
# 1. Build the WASM package
wasm-pack build --target web

# 2. Sync artifacts into the npm package
node moltendb-wasm/scripts/build.mjs

# 3. Install local packages
cd src/moltenDB_wasm_tests
npm install

# 4. Start the dev server (sets required COOP/COEP headers for OPFS)
npm start
# → http://localhost:8000/raw-json-explorer.html
# → http://localhost:8000/query-builder-explorer.html
```

## HTTP API

All endpoints except `/login` require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.  
All endpoints return a consistent JSON envelope with a `statusCode` field:

```json
{ "statusCode": 200, "count": 5, "status": "ok" }
{ "statusCode": 400, "error": "Unknown property: 'foo'. Check the API docs..." }
{ "statusCode": 404, "error": "No documents found" }
```

### Authentication

```http
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{ "username": "myuser", "password": "str0ng-p4ssw0rd" }
```

Returns `{ "token": "<jwt>" }`.

### Insert / Upsert

```http
POST /set
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "collection": "laptops",
  "data": {
    "lp1": { "brand": "Lenovo", "model": "ThinkPad X1 Carbon", "price": 1499, "in_stock": true }
  }
}
```

Pass `data` as an **array** to auto-generate UUIDv7 keys:

```json
{ "collection": "laptops", "data": [{ "brand": "HP", "model": "Spectre x360", "price": 1599 }] }
```

Returns `{ "statusCode": 200, "status": "ok", "count": 1 }`.

Every document automatically receives `_v` (version counter), `createdAt`, and `modifiedAt` fields managed by the engine.

### Query

```http
POST /get
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "collection": "laptops",
  "where": { "brand": { "$in": ["Apple", "Dell"] }, "in_stock": true },
  "fields": ["brand", "model", "price"],
  "count": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```

**All query properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `collection` | string | **Required.** The collection to query. |
| `keys` | string \| string[] | Fetch one or more documents by key. Returns the document directly for a single string; returns an array for an array of keys. |
| `where` | object | Filter documents. All conditions at the top level are ANDed together. |
| `fields` | string[] | **GraphQL-style field selection.** Return only these fields. Dot-notation selects nested fields. Mutually exclusive with `excludedFields`. |
| `excludedFields` | string[] | Return everything *except* these fields. Mutually exclusive with `fields`. |
| `joins` | object[] | Cross-collection joins. Each element is `{ "alias": "<name>", "from": "<collection>", "on": "<foreign_key_field>", "fields": [...] }`. |
| `sort` | object[] | Sort results. Each spec is `{ "field": "<name>", "order": "asc" \| "desc" }`. Multiple specs applied in priority order. |
| `count` | number | Maximum number of results to return (applied after filtering and sorting). |
| `offset` | number | Number of results to skip (for stable pagination, applied after sorting). |

> **Response shape:** All multi-document queries return a **JSON array** where each element includes a `_key` field with the document ID. The only exception is a single-key lookup (`"keys": "lp2"`) which returns the document directly.

**Supported `where` operators:**

| Operator | Aliases | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | `$equals` | Exact equality |
| `$ne` | `$notEquals` | Not equal |
| `$gt` | `$greaterThan` | Greater than (numeric) |
| `$gte` | | Greater than or equal |
| `$lt` | `$lessThan` | Less than (numeric) |
| `$lte` | | Less than or equal |
| `$contains` | `$ct` | Substring check (string) or membership check (array) |
| `$in` | `$oneOf` | Field value is one of a list |
| `$nin` | `$notIn` | Field value is not in a list |

**Query examples:**

```json
// WHERE with multiple conditions (all must match — implicit AND)
{ "collection": "laptops", "where": { "brand": "Apple", "in_stock": true } }

// GraphQL-style field selection
{ "collection": "laptops", "fields": ["brand", "model", "price"] }

// Deep nested field selection
{ "collection": "laptops", "fields": ["brand", "specs.cpu.ghz", "specs.weight_kg"] }

// Field exclusion
{ "collection": "laptops", "excludedFields": ["memory_id", "display_id"] }

// Sort by price descending, then brand ascending
{ "collection": "laptops", "sort": [{ "field": "price", "order": "desc" }, { "field": "brand", "order": "asc" }] }

// Pagination — second page of 3
{ "collection": "laptops", "sort": [{ "field": "price", "order": "asc" }], "offset": 3, "count": 3 }

// $in — brand is one of a list
{ "collection": "laptops", "where": { "brand": { "$in": ["Apple", "Dell", "Razer"] } } }

// $contains on an array field
{ "collection": "laptops", "where": { "tags": { "$contains": "gaming" } } }
```

### Cross-collection join

```http
POST /get
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "collection": "laptops",
  "fields": ["brand", "model", "price"],
  "joins": [
    { "alias": "ram",    "from": "memory",  "on": "memory_id",  "fields": ["capacity_gb", "type"] },
    { "alias": "screen", "from": "display", "on": "display_id", "fields": ["size_inch", "panel", "refresh_hz"] }
  ]
}
```

The `on` field is read from the parent document using dot-notation and used to look up a document in the target collection. The result is embedded under the alias key. `fields` is optional — omit it to return the full joined document.

> **Note:** Joins are resolved at **query time** — the joined data is fetched live on every request. For a snapshot embedded at **insert time**, use `extends` (see below).

### Inline reference embedding (`extends`)

The `extends` key embeds data from another collection directly into the stored document at insert time — no join needed on reads.

```http
POST /set
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "collection": "laptops",
  "data": {
    "lp7": {
      "brand": "MSI",
      "model": "Titan GT77",
      "price": 3299,
      "extends": {
        "ram":    "memory.mem4",
        "screen": "display.dsp3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each value in `extends` is a `"collection.key"` reference. The engine fetches the referenced document and embeds it under the alias key. The `extends` key itself is removed from the stored document.

**When to use `extends` vs `joins`:**

| | `extends` | `joins` |
|---|---|---|
| Resolved at | Insert time (once) | Query time (every request) |
| Data freshness | Snapshot — may become stale | Always live |
| Read cost | O(1) — data already embedded | O(1) per join per document |
| Use when | Data rarely changes, fast reads matter | Data changes frequently, freshness matters |

### Patch / merge

```http
POST /update
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "collection": "laptops",
  "data": { "lp4": { "in_stock": true, "price": 1749 } }
}
```

Only the fields in `data` are changed. All other fields are preserved. `_v` is incremented automatically; `createdAt` cannot be overwritten.

### Delete

```http
POST /delete
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{ "collection": "laptops", "keys": "lp6" }              // single key
{ "collection": "laptops", "keys": ["lp4", "lp5"] }     // batch
{ "collection": "laptops", "drop": true }               // drop entire collection
```

### Paginated collection fetch

```http
GET /collections/laptops?limit=100&offset=0
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Returns all documents in the collection, with optional pagination.

---

## Query Builder (JavaScript / TypeScript)

The `moltendb-query-builder` package provides a type-safe, chainable API that works with both the HTTP server and the WASM engine.

```bash
npm install moltendb-query-builder
```

```typescript
import { MoltenDBClient, WorkerTransport, HttpTransport } from 'moltendb-query-builder';

// WASM (browser)
const client = new MoltenDBClient(new WorkerTransport(worker));

// HTTP server
const client = new MoltenDBClient(new HttpTransport('https://localhost:1538', token));

// GET — chainable query
const results = await client.collection('laptops')
  .get()
  .where({ brand: 'Apple', in_stock: true })
  .fields(['brand', 'model', 'price'])
  .joins([{ alias: 'screen', from: 'display', on: 'display_id', fields: ['panel', 'refresh_hz'] }])
  .sort([{ field: 'price', order: 'asc' }])
  .count(5)
  .exec();

// SET — insert / upsert
await client.collection('laptops')
  .set({ lp1: { brand: 'Lenovo', model: 'ThinkPad X1', price: 1499 } })
  .exec();

// UPDATE — partial patch
await client.collection('laptops')
  .update({ lp4: { price: 1749, in_stock: true } })
  .exec();

// DELETE
await client.collection('laptops').delete().keys('lp6').exec();
await client.collection('laptops').delete().drop().exec();
```

Each operation class only exposes the methods that are valid for that operation — invalid method chains are caught at compile time in TypeScript.

---

## WebSocket (Real-time Push)

The WebSocket endpoint is exclusively for **real-time push notifications**. All CRUD operations must go through the HTTP endpoints.

```
wss://localhost:1538/ws
```

**Protocol:**

1. The first message **must** be `{ "action": "AUTH", "token": "<jwt>" }`. The connection is closed immediately if authentication fails.
2. After authentication, the server pushes a change event on every write:
   ```json
   { "event": "change", "collection": "laptops", "key": "lp2", "new_v": 3 }
   { "event": "change", "collection": "laptops", "key": "lp6", "new_v": null }
   { "event": "change", "collection": "laptops", "key": "*",   "new_v": null }
   ```
   - `new_v` is the document's `_v` after the write, or `null` for deletes/drops
   - `key: "*"` means the entire collection was dropped
3. Clients fetch fresh data via HTTP after receiving a notification.

See `src/ws_test/websocket-test.html` for an interactive tester.

## Configuration Reference

All options can be set via CLI flags or environment variables. CLI flags take priority.

| Flag | Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--port` | `PORT` | `1538` | TCP port |
| `--db-path` | `DB_PATH` | `my_database.log` | Log file path |
| `--cert` | `TLS_CERT` | `cert.pem` | TLS certificate |
| `--key` | `TLS_KEY` | `key.pem` | TLS private key |
| `--encryption-key` | `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | built-in default ⚠️ | At-rest encryption password |
| `--disable-encryption` | `DISABLE_ENCRYPTION` | `false` | Store data as plain JSON |
| `--write-mode` | `WRITE_MODE` | `async` | `async` or `sync` |
| `--storage-mode` | `STORAGE_MODE` | `standard` | `standard` or `tiered` |
| `--rate-limit-requests` | `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` | `100` | Max requests per IP per window |
| `--rate-limit-window` | `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECS` | `60` | Window size in seconds |
| `--jwt-secret` | `JWT_SECRET` | built-in default ⚠️ | JWT signing secret |
| `--admin-user` | `MOLTENDB_ADMIN_USER` | **REQUIRED** 🔥 | Admin username |
| `--admin-password` | `MOLTENDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | **REQUIRED** 🔥 | Admin password |
| `--debug` | `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable verbose debug logging |

⚠️ = insecure default, must be overridden in production. The server prints a warning at startup for each one that is not set.

🔥 = mandatory requirement. The server will not start if these are missing.

---

## Storage Modes

### Standard (default)
Single append-only log file. All writes go to `my_database.log`. Compaction rewrites the file to contain only current state (triggered when file > 100 MB or every hour). A binary snapshot is written on each compaction so the next startup only replays the delta, not the full log.

### Tiered (`--storage-mode tiered`)
Recommended for large datasets (100k+ documents). Active writes go to a hot log (kept < 50 MB). When the hot log exceeds the threshold, all current entries are promoted to a cold log (`my_database.cold.log`) which is read via memory-mapped file on startup — the OS pages in only the data actually needed.

### Write modes
- **async** (default): writes are buffered in memory and flushed every 50 ms. Up to 50 ms of data loss on a hard crash. Highest throughput.
- **sync**: every write blocks until the OS confirms the data. Zero data loss on crash. Lower throughput.

---

## How the Log Works

MoltenDB uses an append-only log format — every insert, update, and delete is a new JSON line:

```json
{"cmd":"INSERT","collection":"laptops","key":"lp1","value":{"brand":"Lenovo","model":"ThinkPad X1 Carbon","price":1499,"_v":1,"createdAt":"2026-03-09T13:51:05Z","modifiedAt":"2026-03-09T13:51:05Z"}}
{"cmd":"DELETE","collection":"laptops","key":"lp6","value":null}
{"cmd":"DROP","collection":"laptops","key":"_","value":null}
```

With encryption enabled (the default), each line is an opaque `ENC` entry:

```json
{"cmd":"ENC","collection":"_","key":"_","value":"base64encodedciphertext..."}
```

On startup, the log is replayed top-to-bottom to rebuild the in-memory state. After compaction, only the current state is kept — dead entries are removed.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run the full integration test suite (56 tests)
cargo test --test integration

# Run with verbose output
cargo test --test integration -- --nocapture
```

The test suite covers: SET, GET, field selection, WHERE (all 9 operators), sort, pagination, joins, update, delete, versioning, extends, validation, persistence, compaction, concurrency (8 threads × 100 docs), auto-indexing, and analytics.

## What's Next? (The Roadmap)

MoltenDB is currently in **Alpha**. The core engine is stable, fast, and feature-rich, but the road to `v1.0` is going to be heavily driven by community feedback.

Instead of locking into a rigid feature timeline, development is focused on three major architectural themes. **If you need a specific feature to adopt MoltenDB, please open a GitHub Issue or vote on existing ones so it gets prioritized!**

### 1. Scaling & Ecosystem
- **Multi-Tab WASM:** Cross-tab synchronization using the Leader Election pattern so multiple browser tabs can seamlessly share the OPFS engine without locking conflicts.
- **Language Clients:** Official transport drivers for Python, Go, and Swift.

### 2. Distributed Systems
- **Robust Sync:** Two-way browser ↔ server delta sync with automatic conflict resolution (server-wins on `_v` collision).
- **Transactions:** ACID multi-key writes with optimistic locking (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).

### 3. Security & Integrity
- **Schema Validation:** Optional, opt-in per-collection type constraints (enforcing strings, numbers, required fields).
- **Granular ACLs:** User management and role-based access control for individual collections.
